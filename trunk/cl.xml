    My experience as an Operations Manager has included a three year position as 
    Production Manager at Rayburn Plastics where I had direct responsibility 
    for two manufacturing lines over two shifts, a total of 120 employees and an 
    aggressive manufacturing schedule and build plan. Prior to that I was a 
    Production Supervisor for three years with Boston Extrusions Inc where I 
    supervised forty employees and managed all aspects of production planning.
